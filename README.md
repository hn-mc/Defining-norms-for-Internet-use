# Defining norms for Internet use

This document is an attempt to create sensible, useful, sustainable and beneficial social / cultural norms about Internet use, in the form of guidelines that should help people who feel that they can’t control how much time they spend online, or how they spend their time online. This document should define what healthy and normal internet use looks like, and what forms of control work the best when it comes to avoiding excessive Internet use in a way that’s sustainable, makes sense, and doesn’t feel artificial or like some kind of self deprivation.

This should also serve as a general social or cultural norm, or at least a norm for the no-surf community, so that we can orient ourselves in a broader society and try to adapt to broader cultural norms and understandings of what is normal and healthy, instead of functioning as isolated individuals who don't even have any reference points, or landmarks, or coordinate system, or norms to help us orient ourselves in this completely new landscape created by technology.

Feel free to suggest changes.

## 1. Defining normal and healthy Internet use

1.1.	There is no fixed number of hours of daily Internet use, after which it becomes unhealthy. It depends on the amount of free time one has, and what they do on the Internet.

1.2.	The time spent online for work or study doesn’t count.

1.3.	The time spent online for recreation should be divided in focused time (like watching Netflix, or actually reading whole articles) and unfocused time (aimless surfing). The main goal is to reduce aimless surfing, but even focused time online shouldn’t take our whole free time.

1.4.	My starting intuition is that no one should spend more than 60% of their total free time online (combined focused and unfocused), and no one should spend more than 20% of their total free time on aimless surfing.

1.5.	This leads to following limits:

    i.	For people working full time, say they have 7 hours of free time. They should limit their total recreational Internet use to around 4 hours a day, and they should limit their surfing to 1,5 hours a day.
    
    ii.	For part time jobs, say you have 11 hours of free time, then you should limit your total Internet use to 6 hours a day, and limit surfing to 2 hours a day.
    
    iii.	For unemployed people, during weekends, etc… If we assume all waking time is free, in that case, the limits should be: 9 hours a day total recreational Internet use, 3 hours a day surfing.

1.6.	As said before, the main goal is to reduce surfing. If someone can pull out 9 hours of focused, meaningful recreational Internet activity a day, kudos to them. But I guess most can’t. We aren’t designed for consuming that much content, and doing so much focused activity.

1.7.	My guess is that once surfing is cut to these limits, it will become quite easy to stay within limits for total Internet use as well, because it actually takes effort to accumulate that many hours of focused activity.

1.8.	The times that I mentioned are absolute maximum times - ideally, less time than that should be spent online.

1.9.	The Internet should NOT be the default free time activity, but just one out of many activities. Free time should be organized around multiple different activities, including sometimes simply being bored at home doing nothing… but without any screens. If the Internet is default, if we go online automatically, without thinking, as some sort of reflex, then we’re already addicted. Finding ways to break this automaticity and default status of the Internet is as 
important as limiting time spent online.

## 2.	What counts as surfing?

2.1.	Surfing is when you browse various websites, read newspapers online, without any specific goal, browse reddit, browse YouTube… browse Wikipedia, clicking from one link to the next, often in a state of diminished consciousness and without reading any article to the end, or watching any video to the end etc… This is what you do when you’re bored and tired, and therefore unable to fully concentrate on one single thing, but you keep yourself stimulated by clicking on any link that seems interesting, often keeping dozens of tabs open. It is the modern equivalent of channel surfing. When TV ruled, some people would just switch channels instead of watching anything.

2.2.	Googling isn’t surfing. Googling is when you seek specific information online. It’s goal oriented, and it’s short. As soon as you find what you were looking for, it’s over. If you stay online after that point, you’re surfing.

2.3.	 Playing games online is NOT surfing.

2.4.	Spending time in chatrooms is NOT surfing.

2.5.	Watching movies or TV shows on Netflix is NOT surfing.

2.6.	YouTube is kind of edge case - you can definitely watch long content on YouTube with focus and full attention, and in that case it’s NOT surfing. But it can very quickly escalate and turn into surfing.

2.7.	Talking to AI is not surfing, if you engage in meaningful conversation or exchange of information. It has other risks though, like replacing your social connections.

2.8.    Reading whole articles is not surfing.

## 3.	Discussing efficacy of various methods of controlling time spent online

  3.1.	One way is to have a time logging app that you can use to measure your total recreational time online, as well as time spent surfing. Once you reach your daily limits, you stop. - Discuss:
  
  3.2.	Or you can log just time spent surfing, without caring about total recreational Internet use. - Discuss:
  
  3.3.	Or you can just log total free time you spend online, without discriminating between surfing and non-surfing. - Discuss:
  
  3.4.	Or you can say: no restrictions, when it comes to time, but I’ll have to be mindful of my Internet use - writing down the purpose of every next action I do… asking myself about every link I click, do I really need it, etc… keeping a “surfing log” in which I log all my online activities, and sort it according to their purpose, insights I gained, their effect on my mood, etc… It could be done in an Excel spreadsheet. - Discuss:
  
  3.5.	Or you can make a good old fashioned timetable or schedule, dedicating certain hours each day to surfing and other online activities. For example you can say: Mondays  3PM - 5PM Netflix, 5PM - 7PM surfing, etc… and so you can do it for each day of the week. Discuss:
  
  3.6.	Or, instead of dedicating hours to Internet activities, you can define hours, when surfing and/or other Internet activities aren’t allowed. For example: After 10 PM - no surfing. After midnight - no Internet at all. Discuss:
  
  3.7.	Or you can allow yourself to use the Internet and even surf without any restrictions, but conditionally - only after you have achieved some other goal for that day. For example, you can say: No Internet, until I complete 4 hours of studying. Once you’ve done your studying, you can use the Internet, or even surf as much as you want until you go to sleep that day, even after midnight. Discuss:

  3.8.    Cold turkey - Quitting all recreational Internet use, and strictly defining what non-recreational uses of the Internet are allowed. Discuss:

  3.9.    Soft cold turkey - Quitting all surging, (but not other recreational Internet use), and strictly defining what uses (recreational and non recreational) of the Internet are allowed. Discuss: 

## 4.	Picking methods that actually work:

At first glance, I’d classify methods like this:
 
   	Best:
   
   	Solid: 
   
   	Garbage: 

## 5.	Discussing methods for stopping Internet from being the default activity:

  5.1.	Scheduling in advance other free-time activities, such as reading, exercise, etc. Discuss:
  
  5.2.	Making a rule that you should be offline at least 30 minutes (or 1 hour) after waking up, and before going to sleep. Discuss:
  
  5.3.	Using alarm clocks or timers, to interrupt you when you’re online, to remind you to take a break, walk around, etc… Discuss:
  
  5.4.	Displacing Internet use with other activities that could, individually, or collectively function more like a behavioral default, something you default to without thinking. This could include reading (even physical newspapers), watching TV, walking around, visiting local coffee shops or libraries, or whatever… Discuss:

  ## 6. Picking methods for stopping Internet from being the default activity that actually work:

  Best:

  Solid:

  Garbage:

  ## 7. Alternative approaches

  7.1. Perhaps the excessive Internet use is not a problem in itself, but a symptom of other psychological problems such as depression, ADHD or executive dysfunction. So maybe all we need is some ADHD medication.

  7.2. Perhaps the excessive Internet use is simply a "luxury" of people with too much free time and too little responsibilities in life. With a full time job, and a family consisting of a spouse and a couple of kids, there's simply no time available for wasting that much time online.

  7.3. Perhaps overuse of the Internet, especially for surfing, is simply a manifestation of laziness. We do it so much, because it's very easy, and it is by definition TOTAL LEISURE. Any meaningful activity, on the other hand, requires completion, focus, etc... and can easily feel like work, especially if we're already tired of actual work, or it's too late in the evening.

  7.4. Perhaps instead of seeing it as laziness, it should be seen in a more neutral way, simply as an inborn mechanism for saving energy. While our ancestors would mindlessly look at fire in the evenings and casually chat with their fellows, in the similar way we mindlessly stare in the screens and casually chat with other humans, either in real time (chatrooms), or in an indirect way - if we read what other people have written or posted somewhere online. So maybe it's just natural.

  7.5. Maybe leisure should be LEISURE. And it means just RELAXING, it doesn't need to be meaningful, you don't have to read articles to the end, you don't need to watch videos to the end... No one expects anything from you... you're not working. You're having fun. Surfing is just fun, recreation... it doesn't have to be meaningful or culturally enriching, or anything...

  7.6. But then, if d and e are true, why do we feel so guilty for spending so much time surfing? Why it feels so bad on a deep level, while at the same time if we were hanging out with friends talking about utter nonsense and simply wasting time, that wouldn't feel that wrong.
